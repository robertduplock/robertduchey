<h2 class=tc> My day so far </h2>
<small class="tc db mb4">— Post date: 22/02/2022 // By Robert Duchey —</small>
<div class="summary dark-gray avenir">
<p>My day so far has been short because it&rsquo;s only 9:05 in the morning. I&rsquo;ve already made a pour-over coffee — my second coffee of the day thus far — and I&rsquo;m sitting at my desk.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-content dark-gray avenir">
<p>Last night it poured rain to the point I thought the entire world might flood. It was Noah&rsquo;s Ark levels of rainfall. Biblical, one might say. Finally, just now, the rain has broken, and a tiny glimmer of sunshine has elbowed its way through the droll grey clouds above.</p>
<p>This morning I woke up tired, as I didn&rsquo;t sleep well. Our bedroom is upstairs, which means it gets hotter than the rest of the house — and with these balmy, humid Sydney nights, I tend to toss and turn in the bedsheets, trying to stay cool. This is all despite the fact I have a fan blowing on me at full blast.</p>
<p>My dog, Charlie, is at daycare today. He loves daycare, and it&rsquo;s nice to have a day off from him now and then. To steal a joke I saw on Facebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love to spend time with my dog</p>
<p>I love to spend time away from my dog</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These days he goes to daycare without any breakfast, mainly because he simply won&rsquo;t eat breakfast unless he&rsquo;s been for a sizeable walk. And the point of daycare is that it&rsquo;s a day <em>off</em> the walks. I walk for about two hours each day, so it&rsquo;s nice to have a break from our usual routine.</p>
<p>Wednesday is generally daycare day for Charlie, which means it&rsquo;s also run day for me. I run twice a week, five km each time. That&rsquo;s about three miles for any imperialists out there. It can be hard to feel motivated to run when I do so much damned walking! Today I might try for a lunchtime run, but I&rsquo;m unsure.</p>
<p>For breakfast, I had a bowl of Carmen&rsquo;s Oat Clusters. I think it was cranberry flavour or something like that. I can&rsquo;t be bothered hunting down the packet to check. They&rsquo;re a little break from my usual Fruity Bites cereal; a unique cereal sold here in Australia. I doubt too many people other than me eat Fruity Bites. I don&rsquo;t know why I like them; I just do.</p>
<p>Mainly I&rsquo;ve been feeling anxious about the recruitment process I am in. I am going for a contractor role as a web developer, working for a government agency. I&rsquo;m not going to say who, for privacy reasons. I feel optimistic about the role, but it&rsquo;s reference check time, and the recruiter is trying to hurry the process along. I guess I&rsquo;m just anxious to know that my referees have filled in their forms and returned them to the recruiter. It&rsquo;s hard when you are asking people favours, as such, as it&rsquo;s out of your hands. She might call me today and ask me to hurry them along, which puts me in a bit of an awkward position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today. Cheerio.</p>

<h2 class=tc> Dancing </h2>
<small class="tc db mb4">— Post date: 21/02/2022 // By Robert Duchey —</small>
<div class="summary dark-gray avenir">
<p>I&rsquo;ve never liked dancing. There are many art forms I can appreciate. I can sit through a three-hour opera, standing in the cheap seats with the surtitles displayed on a little screen below. I can watch a black and white French movie from the 1940s. Over several months, I read <em>Infinite Jest</em> — the epically long novel by the late David Foster Wallace — and let me tell you that book is a tough read, if for no other reason than it&rsquo;s just so damned long.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-content dark-gray avenir">
<p>But when it comes to dancing? Meh&mldr;</p>
<p>There seems to be something so silly about people flinging their bodies around the stage, pulling strange faces, standing on their tippy-toes and flailing about. The pulsing undulations of their bodies, limbs shooting off in all directions — what&rsquo;s it all about? I know it&rsquo;s to tell a story, put into motion thoughts and ideas and physically convey them. Or sometimes it&rsquo;s just to look cool. Either way, to me, it always looks like everyone has had a bit too much to drink, and maybe they need to settle down.</p>
<p><img src=/uploads/craig-chitima-nkdlrnu88_a-unsplash.jpg alt></p>
<p>As I said, I can appreciate almost any other art form out there on some level — paintings, sculptures, installation pieces. I&rsquo;ve been to art galleries throughout Europe and plenty in Australia. I&rsquo;ve stared at Van Gogh&rsquo;s and admired the latest masterpiece by Damien Hurst. I&rsquo;ve tracked down Banksy artworks on the streets of London. I&rsquo;ve ducked into tiny galleries here in Sydney and nodded as I gazed upon the walls and the paintings hanging from them.</p>
<p>That is to say, I&rsquo;ve admired a lot of art. I&rsquo;m not a philistine — honest! And yet, somehow, I cannot get into dancing. I cannot enjoy watching it, and I cannot enjoy <em>doing</em> it. Oh no, I do not enjoy doing it.</p>
<p>Vague memories now bubble to the surface of my mind. A young Robert Duchey, born and raised in Brisbane, just turned eighteen. Shaving his beard and creating a rash of reddish bumps on his neck, putting on his good shoes, and going out shirt. Destination: some shitty nightclub, like &ldquo;City Rowers&rdquo; — the kind of place where the music is loud, the people douchey and the drinks overpriced and watered down.</p>
<p>The only thing I will say at this point is this: imagine a flatfooted, skinny, pimple teenager waddling out onto the overbearingly crowded dancefloor and swinging his arms in some vague imitation of a nightclub dance. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I liked the music, and I wasn&rsquo;t nearly drunk enough. Girls, boys — all dancing with apparent delight — and almost euphoric pleasure. And me?</p>
<p>I was having a miserable time.</p>
<p>Maybe if the music was better, and the drinks cheaper, I could have been persuaded to dance. But no&mldr; not really. I am simply not able to appreciate the expression of oneself through the movement of the body, and the beats pulse through jacked-up speakers.</p>
<p>With so many beautiful art forms to admire, I have accepted my place in the world. I am not a dancer.</p>
