<h2 class=tc> Dancing </h2>
<small class="tc db mb4">— Post date: 21/02/2022 // By Robert Duchey —</small>
<div class="summary dark-gray avenir">
<p>I&rsquo;ve never liked dancing. There are many art forms I can appreciate. I can sit through a three-hour opera, standing in the cheap seats with the surtitles displayed on a little screen below. I can watch a black and white French movie from the 1940s. Over several months, I read <em>Infinite Jest</em> — the epically long novel by the late David Foster Wallace — and let me tell you that book is a tough read, if for no other reason than it&rsquo;s just so damned long.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-content dark-gray avenir">
<p>But when it comes to dancing? Meh&mldr;</p>
<p>There seems to be something so silly about people flinging their bodies around the stage, pulling strange faces, standing on their tippy-toes and flailing about. The pulsing undulations of their bodies, limbs shooting off in all directions — what&rsquo;s it all about? I know it&rsquo;s to tell a story, put into motion thoughts and ideas and physically convey them. Or sometimes it&rsquo;s just to look cool. Either way, to me, it always looks like everyone has had a bit too much to drink, and maybe they need to settle down.</p>
<p><img src=/uploads/craig-chitima-nkdlrnu88_a-unsplash.jpg alt></p>
<p>As I said, I can appreciate almost any other art form out there on some level — paintings, sculptures, installation pieces. I&rsquo;ve been to art galleries throughout Europe and plenty in Australia. I&rsquo;ve stared at Van Gogh&rsquo;s and admired the latest masterpiece by Damien Hurst. I&rsquo;ve tracked down Banksy artworks on the streets of London. I&rsquo;ve ducked into tiny galleries here in Sydney and nodded as I gazed upon the walls and the paintings hanging from them.</p>
<p>That is to say, I&rsquo;ve admired a lot of art. I&rsquo;m not a philistine — honest! And yet, somehow, I cannot get into dancing. I cannot enjoy watching it, and I cannot enjoy <em>doing</em> it. Oh no, I do not enjoy doing it.</p>
<p>Vague memories now bubble to the surface of my mind. A young Robert Duchey, born and raised in Brisbane, just turned eighteen. Shaving his beard and creating a rash of reddish bumps on his neck, putting on his good shoes, and going out shirt. Destination: some shitty nightclub, like &ldquo;City Rowers&rdquo; — the kind of place where the music is loud, the people douchey and the drinks overpriced and watered down.</p>
<p>The only thing I will say at this point is this: imagine a flatfooted, skinny, pimple teenager waddling out onto the overbearingly crowded dancefloor and swinging his arms in some vague imitation of a nightclub dance. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I liked the music, and I wasn&rsquo;t nearly drunk enough. Girls, boys — all dancing with apparent delight — and almost euphoric pleasure. And me?</p>
<p>I was having a miserable time.</p>
<p>Maybe if the music was better, and the drinks cheaper, I could have been persuaded to dance. But no&mldr; not really. I am simply not able to appreciate the expression of oneself through the movement of the body, and the beats pulse through jacked-up speakers.</p>
<p>With so many beautiful art forms to admire, I have accepted my place in the world. I am not a dancer.</p>
