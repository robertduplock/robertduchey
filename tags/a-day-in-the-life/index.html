<h2 class=tc> My day so far </h2>
<small class="tc db mb4">— Post date: 22/02/2022 // By Robert Duchey —</small>
<div class="summary dark-gray avenir">
<p>My day so far has been short because it&rsquo;s only 9:05 in the morning. I&rsquo;ve already made a pour-over coffee — my second coffee of the day thus far — and I&rsquo;m sitting at my desk.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-content dark-gray avenir">
<p>Last night it poured rain to the point I thought the entire world might flood. It was Noah&rsquo;s Ark levels of rainfall. Biblical, one might say. Finally, just now, the rain has broken, and a tiny glimmer of sunshine has elbowed its way through the droll grey clouds above.</p>
<p>This morning I woke up tired, as I didn&rsquo;t sleep well. Our bedroom is upstairs, which means it gets hotter than the rest of the house — and with these balmy, humid Sydney nights, I tend to toss and turn in the bedsheets, trying to stay cool. This is all despite the fact I have a fan blowing on me at full blast.</p>
<p>My dog, Charlie, is at daycare today. He loves daycare, and it&rsquo;s nice to have a day off from him now and then. To steal a joke I saw on Facebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love to spend time with my dog</p>
<p>I love to spend time away from my dog</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These days he goes to daycare without any breakfast, mainly because he simply won&rsquo;t eat breakfast unless he&rsquo;s been for a sizeable walk. And the point of daycare is that it&rsquo;s a day <em>off</em> the walks. I walk for about two hours each day, so it&rsquo;s nice to have a break from our usual routine.</p>
<p>Wednesday is generally daycare day for Charlie, which means it&rsquo;s also run day for me. I run twice a week, five km each time. That&rsquo;s about three miles for any imperialists out there. It can be hard to feel motivated to run when I do so much damned walking! Today I might try for a lunchtime run, but I&rsquo;m unsure.</p>
<p>For breakfast, I had a bowl of Carmen&rsquo;s Oat Clusters. I think it was cranberry flavour or something like that. I can&rsquo;t be bothered hunting down the packet to check. They&rsquo;re a little break from my usual Fruity Bites cereal; a unique cereal sold here in Australia. I doubt too many people other than me eat Fruity Bites. I don&rsquo;t know why I like them; I just do.</p>
<p>Mainly I&rsquo;ve been feeling anxious about the recruitment process I am in. I am going for a contractor role as a web developer, working for a government agency. I&rsquo;m not going to say who, for privacy reasons. I feel optimistic about the role, but it&rsquo;s reference check time, and the recruiter is trying to hurry the process along. I guess I&rsquo;m just anxious to know that my referees have filled in their forms and returned them to the recruiter. It&rsquo;s hard when you are asking people favours, as such, as it&rsquo;s out of your hands. She might call me today and ask me to hurry them along, which puts me in a bit of an awkward position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today. Cheerio.</p>
