<h2 class=tc> If you had the power to change one person's life, how would you do it? </h2><small class="tc db mb4">— Post date: 24/02/2022 // By Robert Duchey —</small>
<div class="full-content dark-gray avenir">
<p>Often you hear people say, &ldquo;if this can save just one life, it&rsquo;ll be worth it.&rdquo; This, I&rsquo;ve always felt, was something of a platitude. Let&rsquo;s face it; if one spends ten million dollars trying to solve some severe and life-threatening issue, and the net result is &ldquo;one life saved&rdquo;, then it&rsquo;s not exactly a fantastic result. Was it worth the ten million dollars?</p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying a human life isn&rsquo;t worth $10m or whatever — it&rsquo;s just that you might hope for a better ROI, especially if it&rsquo;s taxpayers&rsquo; money that you&rsquo;re spending. But what if I did have an opportunity to change just one person&rsquo;s life? Just one person. Do I even get to choose who that person is?</p><p>The main question to ask the person is — what do you want? What do you want to change? Most people, I&rsquo;d imagine, would wish for either more money or better health. If you already had one, you&rsquo;d wish for the other.</p><p>But I will assume this wish is something that&rsquo;s under my control. Something that I can do. Could I give someone a bunch of money? Not really — I have a wife, a mortgage and a dog. I know it&rsquo;s not the same level of responsibility as, say, having children. But my money is not simply <em>my</em> money. It belongs to the people I share my life with. Yes, I could give some away, but I don&rsquo;t think it would be a life-changing amount.</p><p>And I can&rsquo;t give someone good health. I could give them some healthy recipes and an exercise regime, but that&rsquo;s not really what we&rsquo;re talking about here. <em>Life-changing</em>. What on earth could I do to change someone&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Maybe there is something I could teach them. I could take a poor person and teach them how to code, and they could become a web developer, like me. Ugh, what an awful &ldquo;gift&rdquo; to bestow upon someone.</p><p>I could love them or offer them friendship. I don&rsquo;t mean romantic love, as I&rsquo;m taken of course — but I could offer friendship. But I doubt my friendship would be a life-changing thing.</p><p>To recap thus far: I am not rich nor a magical genie, so I can&rsquo;t think of a way I could change someone&rsquo;s life&mldr;</p><p>What valuable thing have I learned over the years that has helped me? I&rsquo;ve never been able to get into meditation, for example. I suppose running has been pretty life-changing for me, getting in touch with my physical body and feeling my muscles and bones. It creates a certain feeling of <em>being alive</em>, and that&rsquo;s a pretty neat thing.</p><p>Perhaps the best way to change someone&rsquo;s life is to be in their life and encourage them to do the things they want to do and be a friend. Help them to be healthy, to be financially stable&mldr; Oh my, did I say, &ldquo;Help them to be [&mldr;] financially stable.&rdquo; What am I, a 55-year-old accountant?</p><p>No offence to any accountants out there, of course.</p></div><div class="tags-list mt3"><a class="link dim color-primary b mr2" href=https://robertduchey.com/tags/freewriting/>#Freewriting</a>
