I've never liked dancing. There are many artforms I can appreciate. I can sit through a three hour opera, standing in the cheap seats with the surtitles displayed on a little screen below. I can watch a black and white French movie from the 1940s. Over the course of several months I read _Infinite Jest_ — the epically long novel by the late David Foster Wallace — and let me tell you that book is a tough read, if for no other reason than it's just so damned long. 

But when it comes to dancing? Meh...

There just seems to be something so silly about people flinging their bodies around the stage, pulling strange faces, standing on their tippy-toes and flailing about. The pulsing undulations of their bodies, limbs shooting off in all directions — what's it really all about? I know it's to tell a story, to put into motion thoughts and ideas and convey them in a physical way. Or sometimes it's just to look cool. Either way, to me it always looks like everyone has had a bit too much to drink, and maybe they need to settle down.

Like I said, almost any other artform out there, I can appreciate on some level. Paintings, sculptures, installation pieces. I've been to art galleries all through Europe, and plenty in Australia. I've stared at Van Gogh's and admired the latest masterpiece by Damien Hurst. I've tracked down Banksy artworks on the streets of London. I've ducked into tiny galleries here in Sydney, and nodded as I gazed upon the walls and the paintings hanging from them.

That is to say, I've admired a lot of art. I'm not a philistine — honest! And yet, somehow, I cannot get into dancing. I cannot enjoy watching it, and I cannot enjoy _doing_ it. Oh no, I definitely do not enjoy doing it.

Vague memories now bubble to the surface of my mind. A young Robert Duchey, born and raised in Brisbane, just turned eighteen. Shaving his beard and creating a rash of reddish bumps on his neck. Putting on his good shoes and going out shirt. Destination: some shitty nightclub like "City Rowers" — the kind of place where the music is loud, the people douchey and the drinks overpriced and watered down.
