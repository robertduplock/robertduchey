I've never liked dancing. There are many art forms I can appreciate. I can sit through a three-hour opera, standing in the cheap seats with the surtitles displayed on a little screen below. I can watch a black and white French movie from the 1940s. Over several months, I read _Infinite Jest_ — the epically long novel by the late David Foster Wallace — and let me tell you that book is a tough read, if for no other reason than it's just so damned long.

But when it comes to dancing? Meh...

There seems to be something so silly about people flinging their bodies around the stage, pulling strange faces, standing on their tippy-toes and flailing about. The pulsing undulations of their bodies, limbs shooting off in all directions — what's it all about? I know it's to tell a story, put into motion thoughts and ideas and physically convey them. Or sometimes it's just to look cool. Either way, to me, it always looks like everyone has had a bit too much to drink, and maybe they need to settle down.

As I said, I can appreciate almost any other art form out there on some level — paintings, sculptures, installation pieces. I've been to art galleries throughout Europe and plenty in Australia. I've stared at Van Gogh's and admired the latest masterpiece by Damien Hurst. I've tracked down Banksy artworks on the streets of London. I've ducked into tiny galleries here in Sydney and nodded as I gazed upon the walls and the paintings hanging from them.

That is to say, I've admired a lot of art. I'm not a philistine — honest! And yet, somehow, I cannot get into dancing. I cannot enjoy watching it, and I cannot enjoy _doing_ it. Oh no, I do not enjoy doing it.

Vague memories now bubble to the surface of my mind. A young Robert Duchey, born and raised in Brisbane, just turned eighteen. Shaving his beard and creating a rash of reddish bumps on his neck, putting on his good shoes, and going out shirt. Destination: some shitty nightclub, like "City Rowers" — the kind of place where the music is loud, the people douchey and the drinks overpriced and watered down.

The only thing I will say at this point is this: imagine a flatfooted, skinny, pimple teenager waddling out onto the overbearingly crowded dancefloor and swinging his arms in some vague imitation of a nightclub dance. I wouldn't say I liked the music, and I wasn't nearly drunk enough. Girls, boys — all dancing with apparent delight — and almost euphoric pleasure. And me?

I was having a miserable time. 

Maybe if the music was better, and the drinks cheaper, I could have been persuaded to dance. But no... not really. I am simply not able to appreciate the expression of oneself through the movement of the body, and the beats pulse through jacked-up speakers.

With so many beautiful art forms to admire, I have accepted my place in the world. I am not a dancer.
