At age seven, I think I would have been in grade 2. I was in grade 1 ages 5-6, so I suppose I would have turned 2 at the end of year 2. So both years 2-3 — during these years I was living in a small town in rural Queensland named Inglewood. The year was probably 1989.

It's so weird to think that I was growing up in the eighties, as I always think of myself as a nineties kid. Back in those days, there was no internet, there were no flatscreen TVs. Our car had no air conditioning, no built in DVD players. Our parents couldn't buy us an iPad because those didn't exist. No mobile phones either, actually. They probably did exist somewhere in the world, but they were not commonplace. 

Inglewood was a hot, dry and dusty town. Population: \~1000. It had two pubs and no supermarket. On the weekends we'd drive to one of the larger towns in the area; Warwick, Goondiwindi or occasionally Stanthorpe. We'd go to Franklin's supermarket where Mum would stock up on Black & Gold homebrand products — dish soap, flour, toothepaste, frozen fish fillets... you name it. Our house was filled with Black & Gold.

At the time, my sister and my dad both hated living in the country. Being only seven years old, I didn't mind it so much. My best friend was also my next door neighbour. Jeremy was my age, chubby in the body with cherub-like features, and short cropped hair. His folks were catholic — old school, tough and unafraid to hit their children with all manner of objects. Jeremy would get up to no good, like riding his bike on the main road, and his mother would pull out a coat hanger or a belt and start whipping. We'd here the cries of pain and feel bad for the kids who lived there.

It wasn't all doom and gloom though. They owned a Nintendo, and after a lot of nagging we managed to convince our parents to buy us one too. Mario, Zelda and all the rest of it. This was the old, 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System. We used to own a game called "Family Fun & Fitness" which is actually a lot like the Wii Fit stuff you see nowadays.

I can't say those were the worst days of my life. I remember games of cricket in the backyard, our skin shining with a thick layer of sweat. Inglewood got hot. And I do mean hot. Often, summer days would approach 40 degrees. Yeech. We used to run the sprinker and charge at it, holding up rubbish tin lids like shields, getting sprayed and pretending we were soldiers heading in for battle.

Just the typical stuffs young boys do. 

In those days I was a senstive kid. I was raised that way, I think. My parents (or, I suppose my Mum in particular, since Dad was a pretty hands-off parent) did not believe in the school of hard knocks, or letting their kids learn lessons the tough way. We weren't spoiled, but we were coddled. Too much so, perhaps... But that's not a criticism. We were loved, and that counts for a lot. Is there anything else a kid wants other than to be loved by their parents? 

I'd take a little coddling over being whipped by a coat hanger anyday.
