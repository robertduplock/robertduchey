At age seven, I think I would have been in grade 2. I was in grade 1 ages 5-6, so I suppose I would have turned 2 at the end of year 2. So both years 2-3 — during these years I was living in a small town in rural Queensland named Inglewood. The year was probably 1989.

It's so weird to think that I was growing up in the eighties, as I always think of myself as a nineties kid. Back in those days, there was no internet, there were no flatscreen TVs. Our car had no air conditioning, no built in DVD players. Our parents couldn't buy us an iPad because those didn't exist. No mobile phones either, actually. They probably did exist somewhere in the world, but they were not commonplace.
