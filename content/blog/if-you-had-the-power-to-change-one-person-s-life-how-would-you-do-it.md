Often you hear people say, "if this can save just one life, it'll be worth it." This, I've always felt, was something of a platitude. Let's face it; if one spends ten million dollars trying to solve some severe and life-threatening issue, and the net result is "one life saved", then it's not exactly a fantastic result. Was it worth the ten million dollars?

I'm not saying a human life isn't worth $10m or whatever — it's just that you might hope for a better ROI, especially if it's taxpayers' money that you're spending. But what if I did have an opportunity to change just one person's life? Just one person. Do I even get to choose who that person is?

The main question to ask the person is — what do you want? What do you want to change? Most people, I'd imagine, would wish for either more money or better health. If you already had one, you'd wish for the other.

But I will assume this wish is something that's under my control. Something that I can do. Could I give someone a bunch of money? Not really — I have a wife, a mortgage and a dog. I know it's not the same level of responsibility as, say, having children. But my money is not simply _my_ money. It belongs to the people I share my life with. Yes, I could give some away, but I don't think it would be a life-changing amount.

And I can't give someone good health. I could give them some healthy recipes and an exercise regime, but that's not really what we're talking about here. _Life-changing_. What on earth could I do to change someone's life.

Maybe there is something I could teach them. I could take a poor person and teach them how to code, and they could become a web developer, like me. Ugh, what an awful "gift" to bestow upon someone.

I could love them or offer them friendship. I don't mean romantic love, as I'm taken of course — but I could offer friendship. But I doubt my friendship would be a life-changing thing.

To recap thus far: I am not rich nor a magical genie, so I can't think of a way I could change someone's life...

What valuable thing have I learned over the years that has helped me? I've never been able to get into meditation, for example. I suppose running has been pretty life-changing for me, getting in touch with my physical body and feeling my muscles and bones. It creates a certain feeling of _being alive_, and that's a pretty neat thing.

Perhaps the best way to change someone's life is to be in their life and encourage them to do the things they want to do and be a friend. Help them to be healthy, to be financially stable... Oh my, did I say, "Help them to be \[...\] financially stable." What am I, a 55-year-old accountant?

No offence to any accountants out there, of course.
