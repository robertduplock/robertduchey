Often you hear people say, "if this can save just one life, it'll be worth it." This, I've always felt, was something of a platitude. Let's face it; if one spends ten million dollars trying to solve some serious, life-threatening issue, and the net result is "one life saved", then it's not exactly an amazing result, is it? Was it worth the ten million dollars?

I'm not saying a human life isn't work $10m or whatever — it's just that you might hope for a better ROI, especially if it's tax payers money that you're spending. But what if I did have an opportunity to change just one persons life? Just one person. Do I even get to choose who that person is?

I suppose the main question to ask the person is — what do you want? What do you want to change? Most people I'd imagine would want either more money or better health. Would anyone else for eternally good health if they had plenty of money?

But I am going to assume it's something that's under my control. Something that I can actually do. Could I give someone a bunch of money? Not really — I have a wife, a mortgage and a dog. I know it's not the same level of responsibility as, say, having children is. But my money is not simply _my_ money. It belongs to the people I share my life with. I could give _some_, yes, but I don't think it would be a life changing amount.

And I can't give someone good health. I could give them some healthy recipes and an exercise regime, but that's not really what we're talking about here. Life changing. What on earth could I do to really change someones life.

Maybe there is something I could teach them. I could take a poor person and teach them how to code and they could become a web developer, like me. Ugh, what an awful "gift" to bestow upon someone. 

I could love them, or offer them friendship. I don't mean romantic love, as I'm taken of course — but I could offer friendship. But I really doubt my friendship would be a life changing thing. 

To recap thus far: I am not rich, nor a magical genie, so I can't really think of a way I could change someone's life...

What is something valuable I have learned over the years, that has really helped me? I've never been able to get into meditation, for example. I suppose running has been pretty life changing for me; getting in touch with my physical body, and feeling my muscles and my bones. It creates a certain feeling of _being alive_, and that's definitley a pretty neat thing.
