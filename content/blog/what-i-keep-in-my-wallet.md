Ah, the humble wallet. The single place, wedged in the back pocket of our jeans, in which we keep virtually our entire life. Drivers license, bank and credit card, health care and insurance cards... honestly, it makes little sense to centralise all things into one conveniently stealable item. And yet, we do it.

I've had my wallet for a long time — my wife gave it to me many years back as a birthday present. Since then, I've wedged all sorts of things in it.

The one thing that my wallet tends not to contain is actual cash. I can't remember the last time I handed over a form of physical currency. Here, in Australia, cards rule. Particularly once Covid came into our lives, there was a push to move away from cash and into debit/credit cards. No doubt Visa and Mastercard loved that! They now take a nice little slice of just about every transaction on record.

Now that cash is almost a thing of the past, do we still need wallets? Soon, I don't think we will — everything will be on our phones. I pay for stuff with my phone; however, I do like to have my wallet. Should my phone ever stuff up or die while I'm checking out, trying to buy a Snickers bar. I saw that happen to someone once at Aldi; they only had their phone on which to pay, and as they tried to pay, their phone was having none of it. A queue formed as the lady held up the entire process. She just stood there, with her phone, continually trying to scan it.

Of course, my driver's license is my primary form of ID. No one wants to get stuck without ID in an instance when they may need it — for example, driving. You must have your license on you when you drive. Of course, digital licenses are coming in, but I couldn't add mine to my phone. And again, there is something about the safety of a physical backup card that won't run out of battery at the wrong time.

My wallet also contains a library card. Last week, I checked out Star Trek: Picard: The Last Best Hope by Una McCormack. Checking a book out of a library is always a joyous thing for me. I feel like I'm getting away with some fantastic heist — a book for free. Yes, you get to read a new release, hardcover book for free. Just read it within three weeks (or get an extension if no one else is on the waitlist). I don't feel that libraries get as much love as they should, even though I wish my local library had a better sci-fi section! 

A few coins also can be found in my wallet. Coins are suitable for pretty much nothing, but they have the extra disadvantage of weighing quite a lot. So I don't keep coins if I can avoid it. 

Wallets... they may be a thing of the past sooner than we expect.
