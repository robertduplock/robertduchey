I always thought of myself as someone who didn't get angry. And to some extent, indeed, that is true. I wasn't the kind of person who got mad at people. I wasn't one to lament the unfairness of life — perhaps, due to my relative privilege as a white male growing up in a western liberal democracy, I haven't felt particularly entitled to a lot of anger.

But I've known angry people. Some people in the world feel like it is the world that owes them something, and when expected to give, they feel as though others are taking it away — even stealing. _Why should my tax dollars help someone who makes less money than me? I've earned my money, and now they're stealing it from me!_

Of course, being the lefty, bleeding-heart peacenik that I am, I do not share these sentiments. So what has made me angry lately? Well, these sorts of people with their self-entitled attitudes do, sure. But I suppose that the last thing I can remember making me angry is a particularly wealthy politician, overweight and vile — a man rich from stealing precious minerals from the earth — a hardcore racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobe from Queensland (home of the Australian born redneck).

I'm not going to name him, but this man spends millions of dollars spreading misinformation, particularly about Covid. I don't want to talk about Covid, because, like most people, I am _so_ sick of talking about Covid. But this bizarre spread of misinformation and this coagulation of conspiracy theorists are something that makes me angry.

Back in the day, before the world of misinformation really exploded, I dabbled in a conspiracy theory or two. David Icke, for example, has written dozens of books about how the earth is secretly controlled by a hidden race of extraterrestrial lizard people. Shit like that is just so bizarre, and I found it fascinating. It was like a thought experiment, something to turn my brain inside out.

Of course, I never believed it, even for a split second.

I guess misinformation makes me angry. The desecration of scientific principles makes me angry. The entire notion that "googling shit" is the same as "doing research" makes me angry. Misinformation has been around for a long time, of course. Companies hired shonky scientists to spread misinformation regarding the toxic effects of lead in paint and motor fuel. How many people died because of that misinformation? One would dread to think.

And yet, decades later, misinformation is back and bigger than ever. Climate change denialists, Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists, Covid anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers. The way these things have become politicised is genuinely bizarre. And I really can't imagine why in the world people would spread this crap in the first place — other than simply to be a troll. There are world trolls, now. Some people just want to watch the world burn.

And there are gross, ugly, horrible politicians from Queensland spreading misinformation, targeting first-nations people with pamphlets discouraging them from getting vaccinated. Dumb, ugly white men.

Hey, I told you I was a bleeding heart.
