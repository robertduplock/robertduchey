My day so far has been short, because it's only 9:05 in the morning. I've already made a pour-over coffee — my second coffee of the day thus far — and I'm sitting at my desk.

Last night it poured rain to the point I thought the entire world might flood. It was Noah's Ark levels of rain. Biblical, one might say. Finally, just now really, the rain has broken and a tiny glimmer of sunshine elbowed it's way through the droll gray clouds above.

This morning I woke up tired, as I didn't sleep well. Our bedroom is upstairs, which means it gets hotter than the rest of the house — and with these balmy, humid Sydney nights I tend to toss and turn in the bed sheets, trying to stay cool. This is all despite the fact I have a fan blowing on me at full blast.

My dog, Charlie, is at daycare today. He loves daycare, and it's nice to have a day off from him every now and again. To steal a joke I saw on Facebook:

> I love to spend time with my dog
>
> I love to spend time away from my dog

These days he goes to daycare without any breakfast, mainly because he simply won't eat breakfast unless he's been for a sizeable walk. And the point of daycare is that it's a day off the walks. I walk for about two hours each day, so it's nice to have a day off from that every once and a while.

Wednesday is generally daycare day for Charlie, which means it's also run day for me. I run twice a week, five km each time. That's about three miles for any imperialists out there. Needless to say, it can be hard to feel motivated to run when I do so much damned walking! Today I might try for a lunchtime run, but I'm not sure.

For breakfast I had a bowl of Carmen's Oat Clusters. I think they're cranberry flavour or something like that. I can't be bothered hunting down the packet to check. They're a little break from my usual Fruity Bites cereal, which is a unique cereal sold here in Australia. I doubt too many people other than me eat Fruity Bites. I don't know why I like them, I just do.

Mainly I've been feeling anxious about the recruitment process I am in. I am going for a contractor role as a web developer, working for a goverment agency. Obviously I'm not going to say who, for privacy reasons. I am feeling really positive about the role, but it's reference check time, and the recruiter is really trying to hurry the process along. I guess I'm just anxious to know that my referees have filled in their forms and gotten back to the recruiters. It's hard when you are asking people favours, as such, as it's out of your hands. She might call me today and ask me to hurry them along, which puts me in a bit of an awkward position.

That's all for today. Cheerio.
